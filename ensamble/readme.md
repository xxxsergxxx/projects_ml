# 🧠 ML Classifier Comparison Project

This project focuses on comparing three machine learning classification techniques:
- **Bagging** using Random Forest
- **Boosting** using XGBoost and LightGBM
- **Stacking** using multiple base learners and a meta-learner

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about auction processes and verification outcomes.  
**Target variable:** `verification_result` (binary: 0 or 1)

**Key characteristics:**
- No missing values
- Unbalanced target class
- Mostly numerical features
- Some correlated features

---

## 🔧 Project Workflow

### 1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- All features are numerical or boolean
- Target class (`verification_result`) is unbalanced
- Clear patterns in some features (e.g., `property_price`)

### 2. 🧱 Feature Engineering
Created two new features:
- `sum_capacity`: sum of all process capacities
- `price_to_cap`: ratio of price to total capacity

### 3. ⚙️ Preprocessing
- Standard scaling applied
- Target variable converted to integers
- Split into train (64%), validation (16%), and test (20%)

## ✅ Conclusion

- Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) perform best due to their ability to handle unbalanced datasets.
- Stacking provided the highest overall accuracy, especially after combining powerful base learners.
- Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning were critical to boosting performance.
