# 🧠 Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my personal ML sandbox — a structured collection of hands-on experiments, research, and visualizations covering everything from basic statistical models to advanced deep learning architectures.

This repository is divided by topic — each folder contains Jupyter notebooks and code examples focused on a particular ML domain or technique.
