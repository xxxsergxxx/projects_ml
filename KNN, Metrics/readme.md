dataset : abalone rings.

The Abalone dataset consists of data related to abalones (marine snails) and is used for predicting their age based on physical measurements. It contains 4177 rows and 8 features:

    Sex: M, F, or I (male, female, and infant)
    Length: Length of the abalone in mm
    Diameter: Diameter of the abalone in mm
    Height: Height of the abalone in mm
    WholeWeight: Whole weight of the abalone in grams
    ShuckedWeight: Weight of the abalone's meat in grams
    VisceraWeight: Weight of the abalone's gut in grams
    ShellWeight: Weight of the abalone's shell in grams



primary data analysis (absence of gaps, presence of categorical features, ...)

feature engineering (build 1-2 new features)

feature scaling

division of the dataset into training, validation and test parts

training of the base model with default hyperparameters

selection of hyperparameters

evaluation of results (metrics calculation, curve plotting)

trying and comaring KNN Regressor and KNN classifier
